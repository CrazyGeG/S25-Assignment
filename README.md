# Lab2 - A ReactJS & Bootstrap Project
I have used the command "npm create vite@latest my-classmates --template react" to create my lab assignment template.

Overview:
My Classmates is a ReactJS-based front-end application that showcases a list of 4 individuals with their personal preferences. The application leverages Bootstrap for styling and layout, ensuring a clean and responsive user interface. Each individual's profile is displayed on a card component, dynamically generated from an array of data. The application is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy accessibility.

Features:

Component-Based Architecture: Each profile is represented as a reusable React component, making the codebase modular and maintainable.

Dynamic Rendering: The list of people is stored in an array and rendered dynamically using JavaScript's .map() function.

Bootstrap Styling: The interface includes at least three Bootstrap classes, enhancing the layout and responsiveness.

Interactive Like Button: Each profile card includes a "Like" button that increments a count when clicked.

GitHub Pages Deployment: The application is deployed online via GitHub Pages, making it publicly accessible.

Implementation Details:

The data is structured as an array called People, where each object contains:

name: The person's name

favoriteFood: Their favorite food

favoriteColor: Their favorite color

The application uses React state management to update the "Like" count dynamically.

Technologies Used:

ReactJS: Component-based front-end framework

Bootstrap: Responsive UI design framework

JavaScript (ES6+): Array mapping and state management

GitHub Pages: Deployment platform

Generative AI usage: 

This is my first ReactJS project, and I'm still learning JavaScript. I use AI tools like Copilot to generate most of the code and rely on ChatGPT for styling guidance, for example the styling for the name card and the like button. After obtaining the initial code template, I carefully review and adjust it to ensure I fully understand each line and meet the assignment requirements.

<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->
